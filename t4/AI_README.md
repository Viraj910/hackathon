# ü§ñ AI Hospital Registration System

An advanced AI-powered hospital registration system that eliminates the need for human staff at registration desks. Patients interact with an intelligent voice assistant (Dr. AI) that conducts natural conversations to collect registration information.

## ‚ú® Features

### üé§ AI Voice Assistant
- **Natural Conversation**: Patients speak naturally like talking to a human
- **Automatic Form Filling**: AI extracts information and fills forms automatically  
- **Smart Understanding**: Recognizes names, ages, symptoms, and medical information
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicator showing registration steps
- **Voice Feedback**: AI speaks back to patients for confirmation

### üè• Professional Hospital Interface
- **Modern Design**: Clean, medical-grade interface
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on tablets, desktops, and kiosks
- **Real-time Updates**: Form fields populate as patient speaks
- **Visual Feedback**: Fields highlight when filled by AI
- **Success Confirmation**: Automated voice confirmation upon completion

### üìä Multi-Mode Support
- **AI Mode** (`/`): Primary AI-powered voice registration
- **Legacy Mode** (`/legacy`): Traditional manual form for comparison
- **Admin Panel** (`/view_submissions`): View all registrations

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Patient Arrives**: Approaches the registration kiosk/computer
2. **AI Greeting**: Dr. AI welcomes and explains the process
3. **Natural Conversation**: Patient speaks their information naturally
4. **Automatic Processing**: AI extracts and validates information
5. **Form Population**: Registration form fills automatically
6. **Confirmation**: Patient reviews and confirms information
7. **Completion**: Success message with next steps

## üéØ Sample Conversation

```
Dr. AI: "Hello! I'm Dr. AI, your virtual registration assistant. 
        What's your full name?"

Patient: "Hi, my name is John Smith"

Dr. AI: "Nice to meet you John! What's your age?"

Patient: "I'm 35 years old"

Dr. AI: "Thank you! Could you provide your phone number?"

Patient: "It's 555-123-4567"

Dr. AI: "Perfect! Now, what brings you to the hospital today?"

Patient: "I have chest pain and shortness of breath"

Dr. AI: "I understand. Do you have any known allergies?"
```
